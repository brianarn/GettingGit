# Getting Git
## April 2011, Webuquerque

This repository is a simple demo, used for creating a very basic series of screenshots and demonstrations of some core Git commands, such as:

1. git init
2. git add
3. git commit
4. git branch
5. git checkout
6. git merge

As well as some other commands.

This demo was built heavily by following portions of the book Pro Git, available at http://progit.org/book/ - and in the presentation, several images were used (with permission, yay for Creative Commons).

Once slides are online, this repository will be updated with a link to those slides, but for now, there's at least the very, very basic code pieces here.

If you attended the presentation, I'm glad you're checking this repo out! I encourage you to register for GitHub, write some code, and share with the world!
